My research focuses on developing material- and pharmacological-based strategies to mitigate the neuroinflammatory response that arises following intracortical microelectrode implantation.\nThrough this work, I aim to advance the long-term performance and biocompatibility of neural interfaces by integrating insights from materials science, neurobiology, and drug delivery. My broader interests include translational neuroengineering, biomaterials design, and understanding how tissue–device interactions influence chronic implant outcomes.\n\nView the tutorial for this template (+ download link)"

Through my self-portraits, I aim to capture the essence of my own being and reflect on my own journey through time. Each photograph is a reflection of my own experiences and emotions. Through my photography, I hope to offer a glimpse into my life as a scholar and adventurer, and inspire others to reflect on their own journeys through the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView the tutorial for this template (+ download link)"

    "text": "The project explores nanostructured coatings designed to provide sustained anti-inflammatory drug release from soft polymer–based neural probes. The coating system consists of titania nanotube arrays incorporated into a mechanically adaptive polyvinyl acetate-cellulose nanocrystal (PVAc-CNC) nanocomposite substrate. The titania nanotubes serve as drug reservoirs for localized dexamethasone delivery, while the underlying polymer softens after implantation to reduce mechanical mismatch with neural tissue. Together, these design features are intended to limit neuroinflammation at the brain–device interface. The biological response to these coatings is evaluated through in vivo implantation studies, transcriptomic analysis, and gene ontology enrichment to identify molecular pathways affected by the combined mechanical and pharmacological approach.\n\nView the tutorial for this template (+ download link)"
